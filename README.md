# Self-Driving-Car-Using-Kivy

It is an AI self-driving car simulation code based on PyTorch backend which can be trained and visualized using Kivy Graphical interface.
The brain of the car is AI made using a PyTorch sequential neural network. 
The kivy window is responsible for saving the learnings/ experience of the car and displaying rewards to the punishment graph as  the car learns to move while avoiding bumping into obstacles. 
Two points are fixed and the car makes round trips between them. We can make any obstacle using mouse click on the screen and the car will learn to avoid the created obstacles and carry on its journey back and forth.
